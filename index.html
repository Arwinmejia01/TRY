    <p style="background-color: #5d905d;">Cloud computing is the on-demand provision of computer system resources, 
        particularly processing power and data storage (cloud storage), without 
        the need for direct user management.Functions of large clouds are frequently 
        spread among several sites, each of which serves as a data center. Cloud computing 
        is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage
        (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. 
        Large clouds frequently have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center. 
        Cloud computing relies on resource sharing to achieve coherence and typically uses a pay-as-you-go model, 
        which can help reduce capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for users. </p>
